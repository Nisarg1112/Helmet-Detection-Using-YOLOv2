# 💡 Helmet-Detection-Using-YOLOv2

👉 In this project, I used YOLO-tiny algorithm trained on COCO dataset for object detection task. I used pretrained Yolov2 model which can downloaded from the official YOLO <a href='https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/'>website</a>.

## 💡 General Introduction of YOLOv2-tiny Model

👉 Based on  the  original  object  detection  algorithm  YOLOV2, Tiny YOLO was designed to create a smaller, faster, and more efficient model increasing the accessibility of real-time object detection to a  variety  of  devices.

👉 TinyYOLO (also called tiny Darknet) is the light version of the YOLO(You Only Look Once) real-time object detection deep neural network. TinyYOLO is lighter and faster than YOLO while also outperforming other light model's accuracy. 

👉 The following table presents a comparison between YOLO, Alexnet, SqueezeNet, and tinyYOLO.
|Model | Ops  | Size |
|:----------: | :----------: |:----------:|
| Darknet  | 0.81 Bn  | 28 MB|
| SqueezeNet   | 2.17 Bn	   | 4.8 MB|
| AlexNet     | 2.27 Bn    | 238 MB|
| Tiny Darknet      | 0.98 Bn     | 4.0 MB|

## 💡 General Architecture of YOLOv2-tiny Model
Tiny YOLO operates on the same principles as YOLO but with a reduced number of parameters. It has only 9 convolutional layers, compared to YOLO's 24.

## ⚡️ How to Use
Just follow 6 simple steps :

1. Clone repository to preserve directory structure<br>
`git clone https://github.com/Nisarg1112/Helmet-Detection-Using-YOLOv2.git`
2. Go to your favorite code editor and open Command Prompt (cmd) amd go to directory where you cloned this repo
3. Run this command in cmd<br>
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Go to `/darkflow-master`
5. If you want to run the model on a webcam, Run following command in cmd<br>
   `python video.py`
6. If you want to run the model on Images run following command in cmd<br>
   `python image.py`
**Note:** Don't forget to change the image location in image.py file
